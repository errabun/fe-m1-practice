1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

  - The purpose of HTML code helps structure and understand the content of what is being displayed on your page.  

2. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

  - We use attributes in HTML elements to help tell us more about the contents of a specific element.  They appear in the opening tag and contain a name and value.  The attribute name indicates what extra information you are supplying. The value is the information or setting of that attribute.  

3. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

  - Everything that is shown within the <body> element of a document will be displayed in the browser window.  
  The head element is typically listed before the body element and most often contains a title element within.  These two elements describe the information or content displayed on the page/document.  The contents of the title are shown at the top of the browser window or in the tab of the open page.  

4. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  - In Chrome, you can view the source of a website by navigating to the top of the page and selecting 'view', then 'developer' and selecting 'view source'.  

5. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

  - `<h1></h1>; <h2></h2>` are heading elements that are used for main headings of a page or article and their subheadings.  
  - `<b></b>` is a bold element and is used to make a word or section of words display in bold font.  
  - `<br />` is an empty element that will display a break in a line.  Typically placed within a <p> paragraph.  Only displayed as an opening tag/closing tag.  
  - `<q></q>` is a quotation element to display shorter quotes within a paragraph. Can include a city attribute if you are wanting to show reference to the location of where the quote is sourced.  
  - `<abbr></abbr>`is an abbreviation element, it is used when you would like to abbreviate something specific in your document.  In HTML5 it can be used for acronyms as well.  A title attribute is typically used in association with the abbreviation element to specify the full term.  

6. What are empty elements?

  - Empty elements are elements that are written as one opening and closing tag.  Examples of empty elements are line breaks (`<br />`) and horizontal line break (`<hr />`).  Typically used inside a paragraph tag and include a space in the tag.  

7. What is semantic markup?

  - Semantic markups are text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your page, but add extra information to the page.  

8. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

  - `<article>, <header>, <nav>, <aside>` are all examples of new sematic elements used in HTML5.  The names of each of the elements indicate the kind of content within them and are subject to change.  Helps describe the structure of the page.
